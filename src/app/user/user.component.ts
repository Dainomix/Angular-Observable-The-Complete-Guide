 * Q. Why don't we unsubscribe in the user comonent, here where we also set up a subscription? (valid question)
 * A. The answer simply is Anuglar does that for you.
 * For the observables provided by Angular, like params but also any other observable you'll encounter
 * throughout this course that is provided by an Angular package or by a feature provided by Angaulr,
 * all these Angular observables are managed by Angaulr.
 * 
 * Therefore, we don't need to unsubscribe manually here.
 * Angular will take care about this.
